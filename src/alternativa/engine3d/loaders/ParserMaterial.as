		 * A material which is assigned to each object that we got as a parsing result. This material should be treated as a debugging rather than a production one.
		 * It keeps links to all possible in Alternativa3D maps (such as light map or normal map) but can render only one of them as a diffuse like
		 * <code>TextureMaterial</code>. To make object that you get after parsing using all these maps you should create a new <code>StandardMaterial</code>
		 * and pass to them all textures. Then you can assign this material to the object.
		 * Since <code>ParserMaterial</code> sores only links to textures, you should worry about loading it. You can use <code>TexturesLoader</code> for.
		 * Can draws a Skin with no more than 41 Joints per surface. See Skin.divide() for more details.
